# Project Name
Maze_Solver
### Project Description:
#### Summary - 
The Maze Solver project demonstrates image processing techniques to detect and
trace a path in a binary maze image. Using Open-CV, the algorithm performs
thresholding, contour extraction, morphological operations, and bit wise
manipulations to identify and highlight the solution path.
#### Course concepts used - 
1. -Thresholding
2. -grayscaling
3. -contour detection
4. -dilation
5. -erosion
6. -masking    
#### Novelty - 
The project leverages morphological transformations to address maze-solving, 
ensuring robustness against noise and imperfections in the inpuimage, 
it consists of wide range on application like in natural disasters like earthquake 
where small robots can be used to rescue.

### Limitations and Future Work:
This program cannot solve mazes other than square or a rectangular type mazes.
In future work we can implement the code with a physical working robot.
